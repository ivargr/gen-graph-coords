# About
This repository contains code supporting the paper _Coordinates and Intervals on Offset-based graphs_.
See the section "How to run the gene experiments" for information about how to run the gene experiments.

## Web-tool for visualising genes on GRCh38

For a demo of the interactive web tool, please follow this link:  http://46.101.93.163/gen-graph-coords/

## Requirements
There are two requirements:
* The python package _offsetbasedgraph_. Install it with `pip3 install offsetbasedgraph`.
* A small python-package for fetching genomic sequences from UCSC. Install it by cloning the repo and installing with pip:
```
git clone git@github.com:uio-cels/gendatafetcher.git
cd gendatafetcher
pip3 install -e .
```
## Setup
Install the above requirements. Then clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:uio-cels/gen-graph-coords.git
```
